                    the elephant population. Sri Lankan Leopard and Sloth bear which are rare and endangered species also inhabit this area. 
                    The park was declared as a wild life sanctuary in order to protect the watershed of Minneriya tank and the wildlife of the 
                    surrounding area.
                    The tank is historically important for the country as it was built by King Mahasen in the 3rd century AD

            This is the only wild life park in Sri Lanka where safaris are undertaken by boat. It gives a rare opportunity 
            for visitors to see wild animals drink water from the edge of the lake and forage along the shore. Wild elephants 
            can be seen throughout the year and the highlight is seeing the elephants swim from island to island.
            The Sri Lankan axis deer, grey headed fish eagle and thousands of birds can be seen here.
